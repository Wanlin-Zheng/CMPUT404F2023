Question 4: What is a Django migration and why do we need them
We use migrations to make changes to our database schema.

Question 5: What do you see after you log into the Django adminstration site? From a high levle, how do you get custom models to appear in the Django admin page?

You see the administration page, custom models can be done through changing the css/html

Question 6: What do you see when you go to /polls/38/ in your browser? What about /polls/38/results and /polls/38/vote? What happens when you donâ€™t put a number, and instead use a string? How would you modify the urls.py file to allow arbitrary alphabetic characters?

/polls/38/ - You're looking at question 38.
/polls/38/results - You're looking at the results of question 38.
/polls/38/vote - You're voting on question 38.

If you use a string, it will be error 404. Instead of <int:question_id> in urls.py, use string.

Question 7: Why is it a bad idea to hardcode urls into the templates?
Hard to maintain, changing urls will take more work. 

Question 8: What are the benefits of using Django's generic views over writing views 'the hard way'? When should you use a generic view and when shouldn't you use a generic view?

The work is already completed instead of writing generic views from scratch. They're good to use for simple tasks such as displaying database content.
